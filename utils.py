assessment = """Given the TOPIC, MOTIVATION, CONTEXT and TIME from the user below, determine if you have enough information to generate a customised learning plan.
            If any of the information is not clear or unrealistic, ask the user a clarifying question.

            For example:
            - If the TOPIC is 'mathematics', ask the user if they can be more specific. Explain that mathematics is broad and has many subtopics, so coming up with a comprehensive and achievable training plan is not realistic.
            - If the MOTIVATION is 'learn more', ask the user what they like about the TOPIC and why they want to learn more. Explain that this will help you adopt more relevant coaching techniques.
            - If the CONTEXT is 'use in life', ask the user to describe in more detail how they expect to apply the skill/knowledge. Explain that this will help you design better exercises/practice activities to help them achieve mastery.
            - If the TIME is '2 minutes', tell the user that this is insufficient. Explain that most skills take a minimum of 1 - 2 months to get to some level of proficiency.

            If no further clarification is needed, extract and rephrase these 4 pieces of information as a JSON object. An example is provided below:

            {"topic": "computer science", "motivation": "to find a job as an engineer", "context": "for my career", "time": "2 months"}
